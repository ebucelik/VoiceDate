Think about what motivated you to contact exactly this woman:\n\nWhat fascinated you most about her profile?\nWhy does she stand out from the crowd in your eyes?\nHas she the same interests as you?\nAn exciting hobby?\nDoes she have humor on her profile, did she make adventurous trips?\"";
"Date2Key" = "\"Show right from the start that you have dealt with your profile and that it is meant to be personal. That starts with the salutation. Always speak with her name and connect a question with it. That's how you signal openness.\"";
"Date3Key" = "\"Suitable topics to start the conversation are, for example:\n\nSports\nHobbies\nFilms and series\nMusic\nTravel objectives\n\nCaution: Absolutely prohibited are issues such as separation, heartache, disappointments in the family circle or too brisk future plans √† la \"I would like to have children soon.\"";
"Date4Key" = "\"With all the creativity that women are definitely asking for, you should always be honest. Do not make yourself younger, leaner, better or more successful than you are. Do not exaggerate.\"";
